# Electricity Pricing Anomaly Detection and Analysis in Queensland’s National Electricity Market (NEM)
This project investigates how to detect unexpected electricity price spikes, known as anomalies, in Queensland’s energy market. These spikes can create challenges for both system operators and consumers and are often difficult to anticipate due to the complexity of the market.
To address this issue, the project used a hybrid approach that combines simple rule-based thresholds with machine learning models. Historical data from 2023 was analysed using key features such as demand, price deviation, and reserve margin. The goal was to create a detection method that is both accurate and easy to interpret.
The results showed that many anomalies occurred even when demand was not at its peak, suggesting that supply issues and market interventions also play a major role. Among the models tested, the Random Forest classifier achieved the best performance in identifying both major and subtle anomalies. 
This work offers a practical framework for monitoring price behaviour in electricity markets and highlights opportunities for future improvement, including the use of more variables and applying the method across other regions.
